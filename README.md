* **Read these instructions repeatedly until you understand, then begin your project. If something is not clear, ask.**

## ❖・Before You Begin・❖

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/) on how to carry out this step and step `3`.
3. Clone your fork, using either the web site or the GitHub Desktop client.
4. Checkout your personalized branch, the one with your name and GitHub handle.

## ❖・Introduction・❖

In this assignment, you’ll work in two languages: XML and JSON; one will mirror the other. For the XML part, you’ll create an XML document that represents students at a university, and you’ll author a grammar, via a DTD document, that will define the language of your XML document. You’ll use the content in the included `content.md` file to create this XML project. You’ll then convert the XML to its JSON equivalent.

---

## ❖・Details・❖

Per `content.md`, your student is comprised of the following information:

* First name
* Middle name
* Last name
* Preferred name
* Student ID
* Email
* Phone
* Status (first year, second year, etc)
* GPA
* Major
* Minor
* Status (full-time, part-time, graduated, withdrawn)
* Advisor
* Date of initial enrollment
* Graduation date

## ❖・Rules・❖

### General

* You may *only* use the content in the included `content.md` file for this assignment.
* Indent all your code, regardless of language, uniformly by 2 spaces. Do not mix tabs and spaces.
* Implement the JSON and XML independently, then compare, as one will likely be more logical than the other.

### XML Section

* Your markup must go in `xml/index.xml`.
* Your style content must go in `xml/style.css`.
* The grammar of your XML project must go in `xml/student.dtd`.
* Comment every line of your DTD.
* Author the DTD on your own; no help from WebStorm.
* Style your XML using CSS so it’s easy to read in the browser.
* Expose any XML attributes to the front end using CSS’s [`content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) property and [`attr()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr) function.

### JSON

* Validate your JSON directly in your editor and/or at [jslint.com](http://jslint.com/).
